## Codebase Patterns

- Webcam: Use `nokhwa` crate with `avfoundation` feature for macOS
- Capture: Follow existing pattern in `packages/core/src/capture/`
- Effects: Add to pipeline in `packages/core/src/effects/pipeline.rs`
- UI Components: Follow existing iced.rs patterns in `packages/ui-components/`
- GIF: Use `gifski` crate for high-quality palette optimization
- Clipboard: Use `arboard` crate for cross-platform clipboard

## Architecture Notes

- Webcam runs as separate capture stream, composited in pipeline
- Aspect ratio applied at export time, not during capture
- Region stored in project, applied to ScreenCaptureKit filter
- Export presets are serializable structs saved to user config

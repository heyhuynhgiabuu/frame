## 2026-02-11 - Started

- Claimed bead bd-3t5
- Created feature branch: feat/bd-3t5-export-settings
- Converted PRD to prd.json with 5 tasks
- Tasks identified:
  1. Create export settings model [backend] - parallel ready
  2. Build export settings UI [ui] - depends on #1
  3. Add GIF export capability [backend] - parallel ready
  4. Update ExportEngine [backend] - depends on #1, #3
  5. Add progress and completion UX [ui] - depends on #4

## 2026-02-11 - All Tasks Completed

### backend-1: ExportConfig Codable ✅
- Added `Codable, Equatable` to ExportConfig and all nested enums
- Added `static let defaultConfig` for default values
- Added `exportConfig` property to Project model for persistence

### backend-2: GIFExporter ✅  
- Created `GIFExporter.swift` (350+ lines)
- Uses ImageIO CGImageDestination for GIF encoding
- Supports customizable frame rate, quality, loop count
- Applies effects (background, corner radius, shadow) to each frame
- Reports progress via callback
- Added to Xcode project (pbxproj)

### backend-3: ExportEngine GIF Support ✅
- Renamed `performExport` → `performVideoExport`
- Added `performGIFExport` that delegates to GIFExporter
- Added cancel support for GIF exports
- Progress reporting wired through

### ui-1: Export Settings UI ✅
- Added 60fps auto-disable when GIF format selected
- Auto-switches from 60fps → 30fps when GIF chosen
- Shows filtered frame rate options

### ui-2: Progress & Completion UX ✅
- Renamed "Export" → "Export to File" button
- Added "Copy to Clipboard" button (hidden for GIF format)
- Added `showCompletionNotification()` with UNUserNotifications
- Added `copyFileToClipboard()` using NSPasteboard
- Clipboard export: temp file → export → copy to pasteboard
- Completion notification fires on Done button press

### Build Verification
- `xcodebuild build` → BUILD SUCCEEDED ✅

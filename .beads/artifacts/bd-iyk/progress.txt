# Progress Log

Bead: bd-iyk
Started: 2026-02-10

## Codebase Patterns

**Zoom Data Model:** Currently in `EffectsConfig` as global settings (autoZoomEnabled, zoomScale, zoomAnimationStyle). Need to add `zoomSegments: [ZoomSegment]` array.

**Timeline Structure:** `TimelineView.swift` uses GeometryReader + ZStack with layers:
1. Background (quaternary)
2. Trim regions (dark overlay)
3. Active region (blue/purple gradient)
4. Audio waveform
5. Progress fill
6. Trim handles + playhead

Zoom blocks should layer between waveform and progress fill.

**ZoomEngine:** Currently calculates zoom state from cursor click events. Needs to check `zoomSegments` first, then fall back to cursor-based auto-zoom.

**Drag Gestures:** Timeline uses DragGesture with coordinate calculation: `progress = dragX / totalWidth`.

## Task Execution Log

### 2026-02-10: Start Work

- Claimed bead bd-iyk
- Created feature branch `feat/bd-iyk-zoom-timeline`
- Converted PRD to prd.json (5 tasks)
- Ready to begin implementation

### 2026-02-10: Tasks 1-2 Complete

**Task 1: Add ZoomSegment data model** ✓
- Created ZoomSegment struct with id, startTime, duration, scale, isEnabled, isAutoGenerated
- Added zoomSegments array to EffectsConfig
- Build passes, Codable conformance verified

**Task 2: Render zoom blocks on timeline** ✓
- Created ZoomBlocksView and ZoomBlock views
- Purple blocks (#A855F7) render on timeline
- Positioned between audio waveform and progress fill
- Disabled zooms show at 40% opacity
- Build passes

**Remaining Tasks:**
- Task 3: Add zoom interactions (click-to-add, drag-to-resize, right-click)
- Task 4: Update Zoom Inspector with zoom list
- Task 5: Update ZoomEngine to use zoomSegments
